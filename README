This is a test project to show how to write Makefile for 
a Go project with multiple packages, and also a test directory.

To compile all source codes and build the main executable, run:

  make

To compile all test source codes and build the test executables, run:

  make test

All object files are put in the obj directory. All executables are
in the bin directory.

If you add a new package, with its own sub-directory under src, 
you have to add the package name to the line

PKGS           := hello foo

in the Makefile. That's all you have to do to maintain this Makefile.
